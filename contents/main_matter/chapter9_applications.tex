\section{Audio Source Separation}
Audio source separation refers to the process of extracting acoustic signals from mixtures featuring target and interfering sounds.
The ability of focusing on a selected source only, while filtering out the rest, is known as \textit{the cocktail party effect}~\citeonly{cherry1953cocktail, bee2008cocktail}
The scenario where no prior knowledge is available about both the sources and the mixing process, is usually referred to as \textit{blind sound separation}.
When it is applied to approximate human hearing, such as using only stereophonic mixture and considering the human auditory system, it is known as \CASAdef/.

[Remmagi thesis]
Two of the mostly investigated areas study either musical or speech recordings [Vincent et al., 2012].
Although music source separation represents a key part of the audio community [Ewert et al., 2014], the focus of this thesis is on speech source separation.
This is of interest for several audio applications, such as: speech enhancement [Mohammadiha et al., 2013], crosstalk cancellation [Akeroyd et al., 2007], hearing aids [Healy et al., 2013], and automatic speech recognition [Li et al., 2014]

Echoes have been used previously to enhance various audio processing tasks.

It was shown that they improve indoor beamforming \citeonly{Dokmanic:2015dr, Scheibler:2015ii, RobinThesis},
aid in sound source localization \citeonly{Ribeiro:2010uj},
and enable low-resource microphone array self-localization \citeonly{Dokmanic:2016gu}.
