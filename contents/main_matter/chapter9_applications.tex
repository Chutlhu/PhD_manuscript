\newthoughtpar{Knowledge-based \vs/ Learning-based}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Bottom-up vs Top-down information processing
    \item Knowledge-based: specialized signal processing and mathematical algorithms informed by knowledge;
    \item Learning-based: machine learning usually trained in supervised fashion.
