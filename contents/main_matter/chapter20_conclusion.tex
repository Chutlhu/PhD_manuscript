\newthought{In this thesis}, we studied acoustic echoes for audio scene analysis and signal processing
The two main lines of work can be briefly summarized as follows:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item Off-grid knowledge-based and deep-learning techniques for Acoustic Echo Retrieval for passive stereophonic recordings;
    \item Echo-aware
\end{enumerate}
This last chapter summarizes the central contributions and presents some possible future research directions.


\section{Looking Back}

After reviewing some useful tools and related literature, the contributions of this thesis were presented in parts III and IVI.


Part III


Part IV

\section{Looking Ahead}
In this final section, we elaborate on some research possibilities that arise as natural follow-ups to the topics discussed in this thesis.
