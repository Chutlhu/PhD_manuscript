In this thesis, we explored techniques for accelerating sparsity- constrained inverse problems.
The two main lines of work can be briefly summarized as follows:
1) Kronecker-structured dictionaries for tensor data;
2) Safe screening techniques robust to approximation error.
This last chapter summarizes the central contributions and presents some possible future research directions.
