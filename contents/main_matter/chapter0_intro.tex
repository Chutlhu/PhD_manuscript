\section{The Problem}\label{sec:intro:problem}
In the context of audio signal processing, algorithms can be grouped according to how they deal with sound propagation.

\section{My Thesis}
The goal of this dissertation is to improve the above state of affairs along two axes:
First, by deepening our understanding of sophisticated scalable algorithms, isolating their essence and thus reducing the barrier to building new ones. Second, by developing new ways ofexpressing scalable algorithms that are abstract, declarative, and user-extensible.
To that end, the dissertation demonstrates two claims:
\begin{itemize}
    \item
    Scalable algorithms can be understood through linked protocols govern- ing each part of their state, which enables verification that is local in space, time, and thread execution.
    \item
    Scalable algorithms can be expressed through a mixture of shared-state and message-passing combinators, which enables extension by clients without imposing prohibitive overhead.
\end{itemize}
We elaborate on each claim in turn.

    \item Definitions, Function, Characteristics
    \item Current challenges
\end{itemize}
\newthought{Inverse Problem}
Starting with the effects to discover the causes has concerned physicists for centuries.

While in many ways, mixtures are not different to any other audio signal, two research questions stand out prominently: • Can we obtain the sources sj from the mixture x? • Can we find the number of sources J from x? These two questions are addressed in the scientific fields of sound
source separation and source count estimation


Inverse problems appear when we want to see or examine something that we cannot access directly. What we have is an indirect measurement that contains hidden information.

An inverse problem is always a counterpart of a direct problem, as shown in the schematic diagram below. The direct problem is going from object to data, and the inverse problem is about finding the object back from the data.

The assumed few thousand taps. This model was very popular in the early stages of research [48]–[55]. Recently, interest has revived with sparse penalties which account for prior knowledge about the physical properties of AIRs, namely the facts that power concentrates in the direct path and the first early echoes [56]– [60] and that the time envelope decays exponentially [61], but these penalties have not yet been used in a BSS context.

\subsection{Echo-aware Processing}
In the everyday context, when a sound reflection is perceived distinctly is referred to as \textit{echo}.
While phenomenon can be observed clearly in outdoors environment, such in the mountains or within huge buildings,
in closed rooms it is less noticeable. In fact, echoes are usually masked by a general reverberation of the room.

    \item Definitions, Function, Characteristics
    \item Current challenges

Auralization is the process of rendering audible, by physical or mathematical modelling, the sound field
of a source in a space, in such a way as to simulate the binaural listening experience at a given position in the modelled space

In~\cref{sec:intro:problem} we have informally defined \textit{inverse problems}, with an emphasis on inverse problems in signal processing.
An inverse problem is a type of a mathematical problem where we start with the observations and we want to estimate model parameters that produced them.
\\Inverse problems pervades all the field of science and engineering:
source localization~\cite{},
image processing~\cite{},
acoustic imaging and tomography~\cite{},
\marginpar{
    \footnotesize
    A historical example are the calculation of the Earth circunference by Eratosthenes in III century b.c.\\
    and the calculations of Adams and Le Verrier which led to the discovery of Neptune from the perturbed trajectory of Uranus.
}

A inverse problems is defined as the counterpart of a \textit{forward}\sidenote{often referred to as \textit{direct}} problem.
Without falling in and deep mathematical formalism and taxonomies which can be found in \citeonly{bal2012introduction},
we will simply consider the following informal definition:
\begin{center}
    \textit{\emph{Forward problem} starts from known input, while \emph{inverse problem} starts from known output~\cite{santamarina2005discrete}.}
\end{center}
Both these problems focus on an operation relating maps objects of interest, called \textit{parameters} or \textit{variables},
to information collected about these objects, called \textit{measurements}, \textit{data} or \textit{observation}.

For instance, in our context, the direct problem may be the estimation of the \RIR/(s) starting from the known room parameters,
and, the related inverse problem would be the estimation of such room properties from the observation of the \RIR/(s).

Formally, a forward problem is defined through a mathematical model, described by a \textit{operation} $\scrM(\cdot)$
mapping \textit{parameters} $x \in \scrX$ to the \textit{observation} (or measurement) $y \in \scrY$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:processing:model}
    y = \scrM(x)
    .
\end{equation}
Then, the inverse problem defines a method $\kinv{\scrM}$ that ``reverts'' $\scrM$ in order to recover (estimate) $x$ form the observation of $y$.
% The operator $\scrM$ describes our best effort to construct a \textit{model} for the available data $y$.
% The choice of $\scrX$ describes our best effort to characterize the space where we believe the parameters belong.

As discussed in~\cite{bal2012introduction}, \textit{solving} the inverse problem consists in finding point(s) $x \in \scrX$ from (knowledge of) data $y \in \scrY$
such that~\cref{eq:processing:model} or an approximation of~\cref{eq:processing:model} holds.
Under this light, the operator $\scrM$ ant the choice of $\scrX$ describes our best effort to construct a \textit{model} for the data $y$ and
the space where the parameters $x$ belong, respectively.
\marginpar{
    \footnotesize
    one can already see the paralelism the the definition of the mixing process defined in~\cref{sec:intro:problem}
}

\textsc{For instance, in Case of} \textit{linear} inverse problem, and for $\scrY$ and $\scrX$ being vector spaces of dimensions $M$ and $N$ respectively,
then the forward map can be written as a linear system:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:processing:linear_forward}
    \bfy = \bfM \bfx
\end{equation}
where $\bfM$ being a matrix, namely the operator $\scrM$ becomes a matrix multiplication by $M$.
It follows that the inverse map associated to~\cref{eq:processing:linear_forward} is the application of the inverse matrix $\kinv{M}$.
% While solving a direct problem the an operator needs to be found, in solving the inverse one either the operator is known and needs
% to be $reverts$t

Typically, forward problems are considered somehow the ``easier''.
In fact, even in the observation model $\scrM$ is known perfectly, it is not always possible to find its counterpart.
This because of
\begin{itemize}
    \item presence of \textit{noise} in the measurement which are not always additive and statistically independent \wrt/ $x$.
    \item the problem is \textit{well-posed} and \textit{well-conditioned}, namely $\scrM$ needs be injective and stable.
    In other words, some information is recoverable, other is completely lost, other highly sensible to noise
    \sidenote{
        \textbf{injective} ensure the uniqueness of the solution, while \textbf{stability}
        ensure a continuity on the data.
        These are known as the Hadamard's \textit{solvability conditions}.
    }.
\end{itemize}

As we could images, many interesting and fundamental inverse problem are
\textit{ill-posed} or \textit{ill-conditioned} in general, even in the following ``simple'' ones~\cite{kitic2015cosparse}:
The solution to the deconvolution problem, where the direct inversion of the transfer function results in instabilities
at high frequency; and the solution a linear system $\bfy = \bfM \bfx$ where $\bfM$ is invertible
may lead to erroneous results and numerical instabilities.

Therefore, sometimes ones have to settle for restring the set of solution $\scrC \subset \scrX$,
where $\scrM$ is stable and injective\sidenote{This framework was originally proposed by Tikhonov.}.
Promoting solution $x \in \scrC$ is can be achieved through \textit{model priors}, namely prior knowledge about solution, which can
be classified in the following methodologies:
the usage of \textit{geometric constraints} that deterministically define the solutions; the imposition of \textit{penalization}
which ``promotes'' solution of a certain shape (\eg/ \textit{sparse}
\sidenote{\textbf{sparsity} is a fundamental concept of this thesis, better discussed in~\cref{pt:estimation}
} or \textit{smoothness});
and casting the problem in a \textit{bayesian framework} which versatilely incorporate prior and posterior density function describing the data.

\subsection{General Processing Scheme}
Digital signal processing (DSP) is the process of analyzing and modifying a signal to optimize or improve its efficiency or performance. It involves applying various mathematical and computational algorithms to analog and digital signals to produce a signal that's of higher quality than the original signal.
It is traditional in engineering to represent complex systems as a collection of simpler subsystems, with well-defined tasks, interacting with each other.
In signal processing, these subsystems roughly fall into four categories: \textit{representation}, \textit{enhancement}, \textit{estimation}, and \textit{adaptive processing}.
Many problems can be decomposed into blocks that belong to one of these categories.

\begin{description}
    \item[Representation] Objects can be represent (described) in many different way.
    Through different representations, some object \textit{information} becomes more relevant and suitable for certain tasks
    than other.
    \\Representation can be lossy or lossless, and are generally implemented through (non)linear mapping, such as change of basis or feature.
    The most famous representation is the Fourier basis.
    \\Depending on the task the representation may be invertible.
    The process of changing representation is often called: Analysis and Synthesis

    \item[Enhancement] Measurement are affected by noise and interferences which corrupt and hide relevant information, making inverse problems ill-posed and ill-conditioned.
    Therefore, signal enhancement, that is removing noise, is a necessary step.
    \\Enhancement constitute a huge dome of methods: form simple denoising by averaging of repeated measurement to
    spectral subtraction to source separation with neural network.

    \item[Estimation] Often we wish to estimate some key properties of the target signal which may be used as inputs to a different algorithm.

    \item[Adaptive processing] deals with adaptive algorithms and filters controlled by variable parameters.
    A common means to adjust those parameters according to an optimization algorithm which rely on statistical properties of the signal of interest.
    They often implement a kind of online optimization where an objective function is being minimized.
    When new data is observed, its discrepancy with the current estimate is used to produce a new estimate in a way that reduces the objective.
\end{description}

Let us give two example of practical systems that will be recurrent thought out the entire thesis.
