\section{Sound Wave Propagation}

Sound is a complex concept and complex concepts creates theories.


from https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sounds/
The main relevant families of answers include proximal, medial, distal, and aspatial theories.
Proximal theories would claim that sounds are where the hearer is.
Medial theories—exemplified by mainstream acoustics—locate sounds in the medium between the resonating object and the hearer.
Distal theories consider sounds to be located at the resonating object. Finally, aspatial theories deny spatial relevance to sounds.

What is the definition? The ethimology?
How is it perceived, how is it measured? How is it represented?

speed of sound

\begin{equation}
    \cair =  331.4 + 0.6\temperature + 0.0124\rhumidity \; \text{m/s}
    .
\end{equation}


If we think at the process of sound production in the light of the classic \textit{source-medium-receiver} model of communication theory,
we can say that in we have studied models for the source of sound signals. We now move a step further and examine the effects of the medium in which sound propagates, and the receiver, specifically a human receiver with two ears.

When vibrating objects excites air, molecules that start oscillating creating local pressure deviation from the atmospheric pressure.
Such vibration of of air molecules takes place in the direction of the excitement, with the next layer of molecules excited by the first layer.
The molecules oscillate in the frequency of the initial exciting vibration, creating oscillating of higher and lower density of molecules.
Pushing layer by layer forward, a \textit{longitudinal} wave is created.

\subsection{The Acoustic wave equation and it solution}
\label{subsec:acoustics:waveq}

The \textit{acoustic wave equation} governs the propagation of acoustic waves through a perfectly elastic medium (gas or liquid) in a 3D space.
The equation describes the evolution of acoustic pressure $\pressure$ as function of the position $\positionSource$ $[\si{\metre}]$ and time $t$ $[\si{\second}]$

\marginpar{%
The symbol $\knabla^2 = \kpderiv[2]{}{x} + \kpderiv[2]{}{y} + \kpderiv[2]{}{z}$
stands for the 3-dimensional \textit{Laplacian} operator.
}
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:acoustics:wave}
    \knabla^2 \pressure(\positionMicrophone, t) - \frac{1}{\speedOfSound^2} \kpderiv[2]{\pressure(\positionMicrophone, t)}{t} = 0
    .
\end{equation}

the constant $\speedOfSound$ is the sound velocity in the medium with dimension $\si{\metre}/\si{\second}$.
As opposed to mechanical vibrations in a string or membrane, acoustic vibrations are longitudinal rather than transversal,
\ie/ the air particles are displaced in the same direction of the wave propagation.
\sidenote{In 1746, d’Alembert discovered the one-dimensional wave equation for music strings, and within ten years Euler discovered the three-dimensional wave equation.}.

Assuming the propagation of the wave in a homogeneous medium, one can obtain eq.~\cref{eq:acoustics:wave} by combining three fundamental physical laws:
the \textit{conservation of momentum} applied to fluids (\aka/ the Euler's equation),
the \textit{conservation of mass} (\aka/ the continuity equation) and the \textit{equation of state}.
In case of inhomogeneous medium, scalar inhomogeneities, \eg/ due to temperature variation,
and vector inhomogeneities, \eg/ due to presence of fans or air conditioning
brakes the underlying assumption of the model. However these effect are typically so small that are typically ignored.


\newthought{Many are the techniques} to solve this renowned equation, depending on the number of variables and boundary conditions.
By applying the Fourier transform to eq.~\cref{eq:acoustics:wave}, the time-independent \textit{Helmholtz equation} is obtained, \ie/
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:acoustics:helmholtz}
    \knabla^2 P(\positionMicrophone, f) + k^2 P(\positionMicrophone, f) = 0
    ,
\end{equation}
where $k$ denotes the wave number, that relates the frequency $[\si{\hertz}]$ and the speed of sounds through

\begin{equation}
    k = \frac{2 \pi f}{c
    .}
\end{equation}

\newthought{The Green's Functions} are tools used to solve linear differential equations with specified
initial- and boundary- condition \cite{Duffy2015}.
They have been used to solve in tens of fundamentals equation,
among which \cref{eq:acoustics:helmholtz} and \cref{eq:acoustics:wave}
for free and indoor propagation
\sidenote{%
By 1950 Green’s functions for Helmholtz’s equation were used to find the
wave motions due to flow over a mountain  and in acoustics.
Green’s functions for the wave equation lies with Gustav Robert Kirchhoff (1824–1887),
who used it during his study of the three-dimensional wave equation.
He used this solution to de- rive his famous \textit{Kirchhoff’s theorem}.
}.
They can be seen as the equivalent concept of the \textit{impulse responses} used in signal processing.
Under this light, the physic so-far will be rewritten in form more familiar to signal processing enthusiast
For omnidirectional point source in the free space, the time-invariant Green's function for \cref{eq:acoustics:helmholtz}

\begin{equation}
    G(f, \bfx \mid {\bfx}_0) = - \frac{1}{4 \pi \norm{\bfx - {\bfx}_0}} e^{- \frac{\Ii  2 \pi f \norm{\bfx - {\bfx}_0}}{\speedOfSound}}
\end{equation}

\newthought{In presence of} a sound source with distribution function $s(t, \positionSource)$ the wave equation can be written
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:acoustics:source}
    \knabla^2 \pressure(\positionMicrophone, t) - \frac{1}{\speedOfSound^2} \kpderiv[2]{\pressure(\positionMicrophone, t)}{t} = s(t, \positionSource)
    .
\end{equation}

% \end{equation}
% where the mass $\mass$ is substituted by the density per unit volume $\volumeUnit$ since the unit of volume $V$ is considered as reference.

% Evolution of sound pressure $\pressure (\positionMicrophone, t)$
% as a function of position $\positionMicrophone = \klist{x, y, z}$ $[\si{\metre}]$ and time $t$ $[\si{\second}]$.

% \newthought{Conservation of Mass}
% \sidenote{Nothing comes from noting. In latin \textit{nihilo nihil fit} ---Parmenide}

% In the field of fluid and continuous mechanics, the this law can be formulated mathematically using the \textit{continuity equation} in \textit{differential form}:
% \begin{equation}
%     \kpderiv[]{\rho}{t} + \kdivergence{\kparen{\rho \bfv}} = 0
%     ,

% \begin{equation}
%     \kpderiv[]{\eta}{t} + \eta_0 \kdivergence{\bfv} + = 0
%     ,
% \end{equation}

% Considering the same unit of volume $V$, the conservation of mass law states that in a system that does not exchange
% neither energy nor mass with the surrounding environment, the mass remains constant.
% This is equivalent to say that the variation of mass inside $V$ is equal to the the amount of mass passing thought its volumetric surface, namely:


% where $\knabla\cdot$ is the divergence operator, $\eta$ is the density (mass per unit volume) and $\bfv$ is flow velocity field.
% where $\eta = \eta_0 + \Delta\eta$ is the total density within the volume accounting for the a static part $\eta_0$ and a variable part $\Delta\eta$.

% The interpretation of the continuity equation for mass is the following: For a given closed surface in the system,
% the change in time of the mass enclosed by the surface is equal to the mass that traverses the surface, positive if matter goes in and negative if matter goes out

% By dividing the momentum conservation law in \cref{eq:acoustics:momentum} and differentiating both members with respect to space, it becomes:

% \begin{equation}

% where $\densityEq$ is the density of the propagation medium at equilibrium. It is not true when
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item scalar inhomogeneities (spatial distribution of sound speed or air density): temperature variation in the medium
%     \item vector inhomogeneities (spatial distribution of particle mean velocity): presence of fans or air conditioning
% \end{itemize}
% In room acoustics this effects are too small, hence typically ignored.

% Sound field from a source in a specific room, we need the source function and boundary condition that describes the sound reflection and absorption at the walls.
% \begin{equation}
%     \label{eq:acoustics:wave}

% By applying the Fourier Transform to \cref{eq:acoustics:wave}, we obtain the time-independent Helmholtz equation
% \sidenote{\textbf{Helmholtz equation:} In mathematics, it is referred to the eigenvalue problem for the laplacian operator, that is.
% $\knabla^2 f = - k^2 f$.  where $k$ is the eigenvalue, called \textit{wave number} in case of waves, and $f$ in the (eigen)function, \textit{amplitude} in case of wave.}:
% \begin{equation}
%     \knabla^2 P(\positionMicrophone ; f) + k^2 P(\positionMicrophone ; f) = 0
% \end{equation}

% In presence of a harmonic source producing waves described by the function $s(\positionMicrophone ; f)$, the propagation of its acoustic
% signal (small amplitude, ideal (non-viscous)) in a fluid medium my be described by the following \textit{linear}, lossless, non-homogeneous wave equation
% \begin{equation}
%     \label{eq:acoustics:helmholtzSource}
%     \knabla^2 p(t, \positionMicrophone) + \frac{1}{\cair^2} \kpderiv[2]{\pressure(\positionMicrophone, t)}{t} = s(t, \positionMicrophone).
% \end{equation}

% Threating the fluid medium as a \textit{linear filter}, this equation may be solved taking advantages of the signal and system theory.
% We get the alternative solution to this problem (as compared with the conventional approach).

% In the typical signal and system theory, the relation between the input (source) $x(t, \positionSource)$ and
% the output $y(t', \positionMicrophone)$ is described by the following relation:

% \begin{equation}
%     \label{eq:acoustics:lti}
%     y(t', \positionMicrophone) =
%     \int \int
%         h(t \kto  t' ; \positionSource \kto \positionMicrophone)
%         x(t, \positionSource)
%         \kdiff t  \kdiff \positionSource
% \end{equation}

% where $h(t \kto  t' ; \positionSource \kto \positionMicrophone)$ is the \textit{impulse response} of the linear filter, namely the response of the system
% in the point with coordinates $\positionMicrophone$ at the time $t'$, if the unit-amplitude impulse was applied at the input at the time $t$ and location $\positionSource$.

% By considering now the generic source function $s(t, \positionSource)$ as input function of the linear system and considering the pressure variation $\pressure$ as the output of the system,
% we can rewrite \cref{eq:acoustics:lti} as follows:

% \begin{equation}
%     \label{eq:acoustics:lti:pressure}
%     p(t', \positionMicrophone) =
%     \int \int
%         h(t \kto  t', \positionSource \kto \positionMicrophone)
%         s(t, \positionSource)
%         \kdiff t  \kdiff \positionSource
% \end{equation}
% The function $h(t \kto  t', \positionSource \kto \positionMicrophone)$ is the impulse response (Green's function)
% along the transmission path between the source point $\positionSource$ and the receiver point $\positionSource$.

% By applying the Fourier transform to both sides of equation \cref{eq:acoustics:helmholtzSource}, we obtain:
% \begin{equation}
%     \label{eq:acoustics:helmholtzSource}
%     \knabla^2 P(f, \positionMicrophone) + \kparen{2 \pi f / \cair}^2 P(f, \positionMicrophone) = S(f, \positionMicrophone).
% \end{equation}

% where  $P(f, \positionMicrophone)$ is the Fourier transform of the pressure $\pressure$ and $f$ in the frequency in $\si{\hertz}$.

% In the frequency domain, eq.~\cref{eq:acoustics:lti:pressure} writes

% \begin{equation}
%     P(f, \beta) = H(f, \beta) S(f, \beta)
% \end{equation}


% If a unit-amplitude harmonic point source at position $\positionSource$, $S(\positionMicrophone ; f) = \delta(\positionMicrophone - \positionSource)$,
% where $\delta$ is the Kronecker delta function defining a point in the space.
% The partial differential equation \cref{eq:acoustic:helmholtzSource} can be solved by first solving the following inhomogeneous equation:
% \begin{equation}
%     \knabla^2 G(\positionMicrophone ; f) + k^2 G(\positionMicrophone ; f) = - \delta(\positionMicrophone - \positionSource)
% \end{equation}

% where the the solution $G(\positionMicrophone ; f)$ is called \textit{Green's function}.

% \subsection{The Green's Function as solution of the Wave Equation}

% Why do we use Green's functions?
% \cpother{Using the Green theorem, the integrated equation may be constructed,
% linking the effect of action of the source, wave propagation,
% boundary and initial conditions in the simple formula.}

% Green's functions
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item used to solve initial- and boundary-value problems, involving differential equations [Duffy, 15]
%     \item defined as impulse responses of homogeneous systems
% \end{itemize}
% Thus they are used to solve the sound wave equation for indoor propagation.

% The solution of equation eq.~\cref{eq:acoustics:helmholtzSource} can be expressed in term of \textit{bundary conditions},
% \textit{initial conditions} and the \textit{Green's function} $g$.
% Such function is found by solving

% \begin{equation}
%     \knabla^2 g + \frac{1}{\cair^2} \kpderiv[2]{g}{t} = - \delta(\positionMicrophone - \positionSource)\delta(t - t_0)
% \end{equation}
% where $\positionSource$ is the position of the source.
% This equation describes the effect of an impulse as it propagates from $\positionMicrophone=\positionSource$ as time increases form $t = t_0$.



% The Green's function $g({\bfx}_0, t_0, \bfx, t)$ is then the solution to the wave equation

% As in Duffy: Acoustic wave equation defined in \cref{eq:acoustics:wave}, can be rewritten
% \begin{equation}
%     \kderiv{2}{g}{t}
% \end{equation}

% The solution of the Helmholtz equation, describing the propagation of a wave in the free space
% The Green's function for a free (unbounded) space for an omnidirectional point sources is
% \begin{equation}
%     G(f, \bfx \mid {\bfx}_0) = - \frac{1}{4 \pi \norm{\bfx - {\bfx}_0}} e^{- \frac{\Ii  2 \pi f \norm{\bfx - {\bfx}_0}}{\cair}}
% \end{equation}

% The inverse Fourier Transform
% \begin{equation}
%     g(t, \bfx \mid {\bfx}_0) = - \frac{1}{4 \pi \norm{\bfx - {\bfx}_0}} \delta \kparen{t - \frac{\norm{\bfx -{\bfx}_0}}{\cair}}
% \end{equation}

% The Green's function for the sound wave equation will be here derived here:

By adding boundary condition we can write the acoustic pressure within a 3-dimensional enclosure.
Let us assume the simplest possible 3-D enclosure: a cuboid room with perfectly smooth and rigid facets
\sidenote{%
\textbf{facet}: each of the plane surfaces of a polytope.
}.
More precisely, let define $\calC$ the domain of the problem as the cuboid with length $L$, width $W$ and height $H$, that is
\begin{equation}
    \calC = \kset{\positionMicrophone = (x,y,z)}{
        0 \le x \le L,\,
        0 \le y \le W,\,
        0 \le z \le Z}

Let $\calB$ be the boundaries of $\calC$, \ie/ the rigid room facets.

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\alpha_r \in \kintervcc{0}{1}$ is the attenuation coefficient of the $r$-th reflection
    \item $\tau_r = \norm{\positionMicrophone_\idxMic - \positionSource_\idxEch}$ is the distance between the microphone and the $\idxEch$-th image of source $\idxSrc$.
