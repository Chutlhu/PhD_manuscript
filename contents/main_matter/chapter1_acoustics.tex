\newthought{Synopsis} This chapter will cross an important bridges: from the physics to analog signal processing
Acoustics is basically how sounds works in environment.


\section{Sound Wave Propagation}

Sound is a complex concept and complex concepts creates theories.


from https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sounds/
The main relevant families of answers include proximal, medial, distal, and aspatial theories.
Proximal theories would claim that sounds are where the hearer is.
Medial theories—exemplified by mainstream acoustics—locate sounds in the medium between the resonating object and the hearer.
Distal theories consider sounds to be located at the resonating object. Finally, aspatial theories deny spatial relevance to sounds.

What is the definition? The etymology?
How is it perceived, how is it measured? How is it represented?

\begin{equation}
    \cair =  331.4 + 0.6\temperature + 0.0124\rhumidity \; \text{m/s}
    .
\end{equation}


If we think at the process of sound production in the light of the classic \textit{source-medium-receiver} model of communication theory,
we can say that in we have studied models for the source of sound signals. We now move a step further and examine the effects of the medium in which sound propagates, and the receiver, specifically a human receiver with two ears.

When vibrating objects excites air, molecules that start oscillating creating local pressure deviation from the atmospheric pressure.
Such vibration of of air molecules takes place in the direction of the excitement, with the next layer of molecules excited by the first layer.
The molecules oscillate in the frequency of the initial exciting vibration, creating oscillating of higher and lower density of molecules.
Pushing layer by layer forward, a \textit{longitudinal} wave is created.

Sound is mechanical energy in the form of pressure variances in an elastic medium. These pressure variances propagate as waves from a vibrating source.

Changes in air pressure (air being a propagating medium) can be represented by a WAVEFORM, which is a graphic representation of a sound. In reality, sound waves propagate through the air in LONGITITUDAL WAVES (and not TRANSVERSE WAVES):

\subsection{The Acoustic wave equation}
\label{subsec:acoustics:waveq}

The \textit{acoustic wave equation} governs the propagation of acoustic waves through a perfectly elastic medium (gas or liquid) in a 3D space.
The equation describes the evolution of acoustic pressure $\pressure$ as function of the position $\positionSource$ $[\si{\metre}]$ and time $t$ $[\si{\second}]$
\marginpar{%
    The symbol $\knabla^2 = \kpderiv[2]{}{x} + \kpderiv[2]{}{y} + \kpderiv[2]{}{z}$
    stands for the 3-dimensional \textit{Laplacian} operator.
}
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:acoustics:wave}
    \knabla^2 \pressureSpaceTime - \frac{1}{\speedOfSound^2} \kpderiv[2]{\pressureSpaceTime}{t} = 0
    .
\end{equation}
The constant $\speedOfSound$ is the sound velocity in the medium with dimension $\frac{\si{\metre}}{\si{\second}}$.

As opposed to mechanical vibrations in a string or (drum) membrane, acoustic vibrations are \textit{longitudinal} rather than \textit{transversal},
\ie/ the air particles are displaced in the same direction of the wave propagation.
\marginpar{%
    In 1746, d’Alembert discovered the one-dimensional wave equation for music strings,
    and within ten years Euler discovered the three-dimensional wave equation for fluids.
}

Assuming the propagation of the wave in a homogeneous medium, one can obtain the equation above by combining three fundamental physical laws:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the \textit{conservation of momentum}\sidenote{its appliction to fluids comes with the name of the Euler's equation},
    \item the \textit{conservation of mass} (\aka/ the continuity equation), and
    \item the \textit{equation of state} (\aka/ the gas law)
\end{itemize}
In case of inhomogeneous medium, scalar inhomogeneities, \eg/ due to temperature variation,
and vector inhomogeneities, \eg/ due to presence of fans or air conditioning
brakes the underlying assumption of the model.
However these effect are typically small in typical application of speech and audio signal processing.
Thus they are commonly ignored.

\newthought{The Derivation of}~\cref{eq:acoustics:wave} starts by considers a infinitesimal volume unit $V$ of a fluid or gas (such as air), whose center of gravity is located at $\positionMicrophone$.
Let $\mass$ be the mass of such volume.
By the well-known Newton's second law, applying a force $F$ to the fluid, its acceleration increase proportionally to $\mass$,
namely:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:acoustics:newton}
    \forceVec = \mass \kpderiv[]{\velocity\depSpaceTime}{t}
\end{equation}
\marginpar{%
Newton's Law II: The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force impress'd;
and is made in the direction of the right line in which that force is impress'd.
\\Orignal: \emph{Lex II: Mutationem motus proportionalem esse vi motrici impressae,
et fieri secundum lineam rectam qua vis illa imprimitur.}
}
where $\velocity(\positionSource, t)$ denotes the volume velocity and $t$ the time $[\si{\second}]$.
The force can be expressed in terms of difference of acoustic pressure $p$ at $\positionMicrophone$ on a surface of the volume, $\surface$, namely
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:acoustics:pressure}
    \forceVec = - V \kbracket{\kgrad{\pressureSpaceTime}}
\end{equation}
where $\kgrad{}$ is is the gradient operator.
By combining \cref{eq:acoustics:newton,eq:acoustics:pressure}, we obtain the famous \textit{Euler's equation of motion}:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:acoustics:euler}
    \kgrad{\pressureSpaceTime} = - \densityEq \kpderiv[]{\velocity\depSpaceTime}{t}
\end{equation}
where $\densityEq = \frac{\mass}{\surface}$ is the static density of the medium
\footnote{%
\label{fn:acoustics:airconstanc}
\\Air Denisity $\density_{\text{air}} = 1.18 \tfrac{\si{\kilogram}}{\si{\metre^3}}$.
\\Air Gas constant $R_{\text{air}} = 286.9 \tfrac{\si{\joule}}{\si{\kilogram} \si{\mole}}$.
\\Air Adiabatic index $\gamma_{\text{air}} = 1.4$.
\\Speed of sound in air $\speedOfSound_{\text{air}} = 343.1 \tfrac{\si{\metre}}{\si{\second}}$.
}.

\newthought{Secondly, by the Conservation of Mass} principle,
the total mass must remain constant as the it is in a deformable medium. This principle
translates into the \textit{continuity equation}, written in the differential form:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:acoustics:continuity}
    \kpderiv[]{\eta\depSpaceTime}{t} = V \kbracket{\divergence{\bfq\depSpaceTime}}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\eta\depSpaceTime$ is the the amount of the quantity q per unit volume
    \item $\eta\depSpaceTime$ is the volume variation due to the pressure changing
\end{itemize}
inside the volume $\volumeUnit$ in time is equal to the total amount of mass passing thought the surface .

\newthought{Finally, the State Equation} describes the properties of the propagation medium.
Assuming that the fluid (or gas) to be ideal, the \textit{Charles-Boyle} gas law states\sidenote{The original gas law writes $P V = n R T$. Here the law is written in terms of \textit{specific volume}}
\begin{equation}
    P V = R T
\end{equation}
where $P$ is the total pressure on the volume $V$; $T$ the absolute temperature in degrees Kelvin and $R$ is specific gas constant\cref{fn:acoustics:airconstanc}.
The dependency upon space and time $\depSpaceTime$ is here omitted for sake of compactness and readability.

Since the exchange of heat of wave of acoustic frequencies range in negligible, the whole process can be considered thermodynamically \textit{adiabatic}.
In such scenario, the relation between the total pressure and the volume is given by
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:acoustics:state}
    P V^\gamma = \const
\end{equation}
where $\gamma$ is the adiabatic index of the medium~\cref{fn:acoustics:airconstanc}.

The total pressure and the total volume consist in a sum of a constant and a variable term, that is $P = P_0 + p$, $V = V_0 + \nu$ respectively.
Considering that $p \ll P_0$ and $\nu \ll V_0$, the time-differential of~\cref{eq:acoustics:state} with respect to time reads
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:acoustics:statediff}
    \kpderiv[]{\pressureSpaceTime}{t} = - \gamma \frac{P_0}{V_0} \kpderiv[]{\nu\depSpaceTime}{t}
\end{equation}

\newthought{Finally, the Acoustic Wave Equation} can be now derived by combining together
the equation of motion~\ref{eq:acoustics:euler},
the continuity equation~\ref{eq:acoustics:continuity},
and the state equation~\ref{eq:acoustics:statediff}.
In particular the combination of~\cref{eq:acoustics:continuity,eq:acoustics:statediff},
\begin{equation}
    \kpderiv[]{\pressureSpaceTime}{t} = - \gamma P_0 \kbracket{\divergence{\bfq\depSpaceTime}}
    ,
\end{equation}
can be differentiated with respect to time $t$ yielding to
\begin{equation}
    \kpderiv[2]{\pressureSpaceTime}{t} = - \gamma P_0 \kbracket{\divergence{\kpderiv[]{\bfq\depSpaceTime}{t}}}
    .
\end{equation}
Taking the divergence of each side of the~\cref{eq:acoustics:euler}, we get
\marginpar{%
The \textit{Laplacian} of a function is the given by the divergence of the gradient of that function,
\\in math $\knabla^2 x = \divergence{\kgrad{x}}$}
\begin{equation}
    \knabla^2 \pressureSpaceTime = -\densityEq \kbracket{\divergence{q\depSpaceTime}}
\end{equation}
The above two equation can be combined leading to
\begin{equation}
    \knabla^2 \pressureSpaceTime = \frac{1}{\speedOfSound^2} \kpderiv[2]{\pressureSpaceTime}{t}
\end{equation}
where the $\speedOfSound$ is the speed of sound and is related to the medium properties through
\begin{equation}
    \speedOfSound^2 = \frac{\gamma P_0}{\densityEq}
    .
\end{equation}


\newthoughtpar{The Helmholtz's equation}
The wave equation~\ref{eq:acoustics:wave} is expressed in the space-time domain $\depSpaceTime$.
By applying the temporal Fourier transform to the wave equation we obtain the time-independent \textit{Helmholtz equation} is obtained, \ie/
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:acoustics:helmholtz}
    \knabla^2 P(\positionMicrophone, f) + k^2 P(\positionMicrophone, f) = 0
    ,
\end{equation}
where $k \frac{2 \pi f}{c}$ denotes the \textit{wave number}, that relates the frequency $[\si{\hertz}]$ and the propagation velocity.

The wave equation~\ref{eq:acoustics:wave} and the Helmholtz's equation~\ref{eq:acoustics:helmholtz} are source independent,
namely no source is present in the medium. Therefore they called \textit{homogeneous} as the right-hand term are zero.

Normally the sound field is a complex field generated by multiple acoustics sources. As consequence, the two equation becames
inhomogeneous as some non-zero terms needs to be added to the right-hand sides.
\todo{cite [27]}

In presence of a sound source producing waves with distribution function $s(t, \positionSource)$, the wave equation can be written
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:acoustics:source}
    \knabla^2 \pressureSpaceTime - \frac{1}{\speedOfSound^2} \kpderiv[2]{\pressureSpaceTime}{t} = s(t, \positionSource)
    .
\end{equation}
Then, the correspondent Helmholtz's equation writes
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:acoustics:source_freq}
    \knabla^2 P(\positionMicrophone, f) + k^2 P(\positionMicrophone, f) = - S(\positionSource, f)
    .
\end{equation}

For instance one can assume an infinitesimally small pulsating sphere locate at $\positionSource$ radiating constant acoustic energy at frequency $f$.
For the receiver position $\positionMicrophone \neq \positionSource$, the Helmholtz's equation writes

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:acoustics:green_definition}
    \knabla^2 H(f, \positionMicrophone \mid \positionSource)
     + k^2 H(f, \positionMicrophone \mid \positionSource) = - \delta(\positionMicrophone - \positionSource)
    ,
\end{equation}
where the term $H(f, \positionMicrophone \mid \positionSource)$ is an \textit{Green's function}.
For the properties of the Green's functions, $H(f, \positionMicrophone \mid \positionSource)$ is also solution of the homogeneous Helmholtz equation~\ref{eq:acoustics:helmholtz}.
The source is describe here by $\delta(\positionMicrophone - \positionSource)$, which in this context is a 3-dimension Dirac function.
We will see in the next subsection that the function $H$ solving~\ref{eq:acoustics:green_definition} can be interpreted as the free-field \textit{Transfer Function}
between the source at $\positionSource$ and the receiver at $\positionMicrophone$.

\subsection{... and its solution as Green's function}
\textsc{The Green's Functions} are mathematical tools for solving linear differential equations with specified initial- and boundary- condition \cite{Duffy2015}.
\marginpar{%
\footnotesize
By 1950 Green’s functions for Helmholtz’s equation were used to find the
wave motions due to flow over a mountain  and in acoustics.
Green’s functions for the wave equation lies with Gustav Robert Kirchhoff (1824–1887),
who used it during his study of the three-dimensional wave equation.
He used this solution to derive his famous \textit{Kirchhoff’s theorem}.
\\--- Duffy, 2015.
}
They have been used to solve many fundamentals equation, among which \cref{eq:acoustics:helmholtz,eq:acoustics:wave} for both free and indoor propagation.
They can be seen as the equivalent concept of the \textit{impulse responses} (\resp/ transfer function) used in signal processing.
Under this light and by assuming the fluid  medium as the \textit{linear filter}, the physic so-far can be rewritten in the vocabulary of
the communication theory, namely \textit{input}, \textit{filter} and \textit{output}.

Green say that the partial differential equations above can be solved for arbitrary source as follows:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:acoustics:helmholz_conv}
    P(f, \positionMicrophone) = \iiint_{\volume_\contSource} H(f, \positionMicrophone \mid \positionSource) S(f, \positionSource) \kdiff\positionSource
    ,
\end{equation}
where $\volume_\contSource$ denotes the source volume,
and  $\kdiff\positionSource =  \kdiff{x_\contSource}\,\kdiff{y_\contSource}\,\kdiff{z_\contSource}$ the  differential  volume element at position $\positionSource$.

It can be shown \cite{Kutruff} that the time-invariant Green's function for~\cref{eq:acoustics:helmholtz,eq:acoustics:green_definition} writes
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:acoustics:greenFreeFreq}
    H(f, \positionMicrophone \mid \positionSource) = - \frac{1}{4 \pi \norm{\positionMicrophone - \positionSource}} e^{- \frac{\Ii 2 \pi f \norm{\positionMicrophone - \positionSource}}{\speedOfSound}}
\end{equation}
where $\norm{\cdot}$ denotes the Euclidean norm.
\\By applying the inverse Fourier transform to the result above, we can write the time-domain Green's function as
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:acoustics:greenFreeTime}
    h(t, \positionMicrophone \mid \positionSource) =
        - \frac{1}{4 \pi \norm{\positionMicrophone - \positionSource}}
        \diracOf{t - \frac{\norm{\positionMicrophone - \positionSource}}{\speedOfSound}}
\end{equation}
where $\diracOf{\cdot}$ is the time-directional Dirac delta function.
This corresponds to a pure impulse at time $t = \tfrac{\norm{\positionMicrophone - \positionSource}}{\speedOfSound}$,
\ie/ the propagation time from $\positionSource$ to $\positionMicrophone$.

\newthought{Finally,} the initial sound pressure $\pressureSpaceTime$ can now be computed by taking the frequency-directional inverse Fourier transform of \cref{eq:acoustics:helmholz_conv}.

\section{Acoustic Reflections}

\todo{From Schimmel's paper, Kutruff and Remaggi}
\todo{Speak about far-field}
% The acoustic reflection are the main object of this thesis.
The equations derived so far assumed unbounded medium, \ie/ free space: a rare scenario in everyday applications.
Real mediums are bounded, limited, at least partially.
For instance for the sound (wave) in a room, the air (propagation medium) is bounded by walls, ceiling, and floor.
When sound travel outdoor, the ground acts as a boundary for one of the propagation direction.
Thus, the sound wave does not just stop when it reaches the end of the medium or when it encounters an obstacle in its path.
Rather, a sound wave will undergo certain behaviors depending on the obstacle acoustics and geometrical properties, including
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{reflection} off the obstacle,
    \item \textit{diffraction} around the obstacle,
    \item and \textit{transmission} into the obstacle.
\end{itemize}

In order, reflections arise typically when a sound wave hit a large surface, like a room wall.
\\Instead, when the sound meet an wall edge or a slit, the wave diffracts, namely it bends around the corners of an obstacle.
This effect can be seen as diffracting object or aperture effectively becomes a secondary source of the propagating wave, which
may interact with the first one.
\\The part of energy transmitted to the object may be absorbed or refracted.
In fact, the object is characterized by a proper acoustic resistance (\textit{impedance}), which
describes its acoustic inertia and the energy dissipated, similarly to an electric components.
The other part may continue to propagate causing resulting in the \textit{refraction} phenomenon.
This is more commonly observed when light pass thought different medium, like a prism.

\newthought{When sound reflects}, part of its energy
\begin{itemize}
    \item is reflected \textit{specularly}, \ie/, the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection;
    \item is reflected \textit{diffusely} - or \textit{scattered}, \ie/, scatter in every direction);
    \item and part of its energy is absorbed by the surface.
\end{itemize}
The proportion of these quantities depends on the acoustics and geometrical properties of surface.
It is also dependent on the angle of incidence of the sound wave\sidenote{Depending on the application,
all this factors are different level of importances.}.

In general, all these phenomena occurs with different level of importance depending on the acoustic and physical
\textit{operating point}.
, it is common in acoustics and in some field of audio signal processing, \ie/
\textit{beamforming}, it is common to characterized this point with the sound wavelength $[\si{\metre}]$,
\begin{equation}
    \lambda = \frac{2 \pi}{k} = \frac{\speedOfSound}{f}
    ,
\end{equation}
where $f$ is the sound frequency.
$\lambda$ measures the spatial distance between two molecules in the medium having the same value of pressure, or
the length of \emph{step} of the wave.
\marginpar{%
a frequency of $\SI{1}{\kHz}$ corresponds to a wavelength of approximately $\SI{34}{\cm}$ ,
which is one or two orders of magnitude smaller than typical linear dimensions of rooms,
as well as typical distances traveled by sound waves in a room
}
\\Using this quantity we can identify the following three response of the objects (irregularities) of size $d$ to a plane-wave
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\lambda \gg d$, the irregularities are negligible and the sound wave reflection is of specular type;
    \item $\lambda \approx d$, the irregularities break the sound waves which is reflected towards every direction;
    \item $\lambda \ll d$, each irregularities is a surface reflecting specularly the sound waves.
\end{itemize}

% All these effects contributes to create a rich
% It is interesting to note that the diffraction waves produced by the semi-infinite reflector edge allow the area that is “behind” the reflector (i.e. the so called shadow zone), to be reached by the propagating sound.

In the previous section, we manipulated the wave equation in free space, namely unbounded medium.
However in case of modeling reflection for indoor propagation, working with those formulas might results complicated and difficult.
A simplified yet effective approach is to model incoming sound waves as \textit{acoustic rays}, namely
a small portion of a the wave emitted by a point source in a room.
This ray has well-defined direction and velocity of propagation, and conveys a total energy which remains constant.
This simplified description undergoes with the name of \textit{geometrical acoustics} (GA), and share many fundamentals with geometrical optics.

This model will be convenient to describe and visualize the reflection behavior hereafter.

\subsection{Large smooth surfaces, specular reflections and echoes}
\todo{Savioja2015geometric}
% The main focus of this section and the this whole thesis goes on \textit{specular reflections}.
Specular reflection occurs when sound bounce off room walls which can be modelled as infinite flat and smooth surfaces.
This happens when the surface has dimension much bigger than the sound wavelength and it results in a mirror-like effects.
Here the acoustic ray that strikes a plane surface is reflected according to the \textit{law of reflection}, stating the following principles:
(i) the reflected ray remains in the plane identified by the incident ray and the normal to the surface,
and (ii) the angles of the incident and reflected rays with the normal are equal.
\marginpar{%

        Specular reflection
    }
    \label{fig:mirage:scene}
}

\newthoughtpar{Absorption (and Reflection) coefficient}
The proportion of energy absorbed by the surface and the incident acoustic wave is measured
through the reflector's \textit{acoustic impedance}\sidenote{%
\textbf{acoustic impendence} measures the opposition that an acoustic system presents to the acoustic pressure.
}.
By relating the acoustic pressure at the reflector location with the velocity of the incoming plane waves,
one can derive the \textit{plane-wave reflection coefficient} or \textit{pressure reflector factor} $\reflCoeff$ \cite{kuttruff} as
\begin{equation}
    \reflCoeff(f, \theta) = \frac{\impedence_w(f)\cos(\theta) - \impedenceAir(f)}{\impedence_w(f)\cos(\theta) + \impedenceAir(f)}
    ,
\end{equation}
where $\impedence_w(f)$ and $\impedenceAir(f)$ are the frequency-dependent impedance of the surface and the air respectively,
and $\theta$ is the angle of incidence.

This formula holds as long as the far field assumption is verified as well for the reflectors:
the source, or receiver, is several wavelengths away from the infinite reflecting plane.

Within the context of \GA, it is common to use consider the energy or the intensity of the plane wave, which is
proportional to the square of the pressure amplitude. Thus, it is customary to use the absorption coefficient,
\begin{equation}
    \absCoeff = 1 - \abs{\reflCoeff(f, \theta)}^2
    ,
\end{equation}
where the phase information of the reflection process is lost.
\\Estimating acoustic impedance and absorption coefficient of a real material and difference between them has long been a topic of study
In audio signal processing and in acoustics,

However, data made available by surface material manufacturers is typically measured according to the reverberation room standard, with octave-band or third-octave-band reso- lution for the range 100 Hz–5 kHz,
true arand has long been a topic of study

Moreover, the dependency on the angle is often relaxed in favor of a more simplified yet solid parameter where
averaged across incidence angles h is the quantity that is used by various implementations of the GA techniques.


Specular reflection results in a delta-like peak in the function such that all of the energy is reflected in one direction, while the function takes on a value of 0 elsewhere


\subsection{Scattering and Diffraction}
Real-world surfaces are not ideally flat and smooth; they
include various irregularities. Irregularities that are substan- tially smaller than the wavelength can be neglected because they do not affect the reflection, whereas irregularities that are much larger than the wavelength can be thought of as curved surfaces or even as a locally flat surface. However, irregularities whose dimensions are of the same order of magnitude as the wavelength of sound can have a large effect on the reflected sound. This means that a single absorption coefficient or complex impedance is insufficient to describe the acoustic properties of such a surface or mate- rial, even if the coefficients are frequency dependent. Instead, more complicated measures are needed in modeling such materials.


Important:
Siltanen et al.52 have described how to apply this reflection model in practice with beam-tracing. Their results show that although the values of the room acoustic attributes remain within just- noticeable-differences, the model results in audible differen- ces in auralization

\section{From Acoustics to Room Impulse Response via Geometrical Room Acoustics}
By adding boundary condition we can write the acoustic pressure within a 3-dimensional enclosure.
Let us assume the simplest possible 3-D enclosure: a cuboid room with perfectly smooth and rigid facets
\sidenote{%
\textbf{facet}: each of the plane surfaces of a polytope.
}.
More precisely, let define $\calC$ the domain of the problem as the cuboid with length $L$, width $W$ and height $H$, that is
\begin{equation}
    \calC = \kset{\positionMicrophone = (x,y,z)}{
        0 \le x \le L,\,
        0 \le y \le W,\,
        0 \le z \le Z}
\end{equation}
Let $\calB$ be the boundaries of $\calC$, \ie/ the rigid room facets.

The multiple sound propagation paths from a source to a
receiver in a room can be modeled accurately by a linear time- invariant system defined by the so-called room impulse re- sponse. A room impulse response contains several perceptu- ally relevant components

\subsection{the Image Source Method}
https://reuk.github.io/wayverb/context.html

\newthought{Finally} we can write the final Room Impulse Response $\rir_{ij}(t)$ as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \contMicrophoneSignal(t) = (\rir_{ij} \conv \contSource)(t)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \rir_{ij}(t) = \sum_{r=0}^{R} \frac{\alpha_r}{4 \pi \tau_r / \cair} \delta \kparen{t - \tau_r}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\alpha_r \in \kintervcc{0}{1}$ is the attenuation coefficient of the $r$-th reflection
    \item $\tau_r = \norm{\positionMicrophone_\idxMic - \positionSource_\idxEch}$ is the distance between the microphone and the $\idxEch$-th image of source $\idxSrc$.
